CareFlow AI is an Agentic AI-powered discharge copilot that acts like a virtual staff member. It autonomously coordinates between departments, systems, and staff using LLM-based reasoning. 

Key capabilities: 
●	Detects discharge triggers from EHRs 
 
●	Automates checklists across staff 
 
●	Notifies stakeholders (staff, family, pharmacy, billing) via WhatsApp/SMS/Email APIs 
 
●	Generates AI-powered discharge summaries using GPT-4o/Claude 3 
 
●	Provides real-time dashboards for hospital managers to track bottlenecks 
 
Result: Discharges are done in minutes, not hours—freeing beds faster and improving patient experience. 


Workflow Example 
1.	Doctor marks a patient “fit for discharge” in EHR 
 
2.	CareFlow AI detects trigger → launches discharge workflow 
 
3.	Nurse tasks auto-assigned (IV removal, vitals check) 
 
4.	Pharmacy auto-alerted for final meds 
 
5.	Billing system notified → generates final bill & insurance claim 
 
6.	Patient relatives auto-notified via WhatsApp 
 
7.	Transport scheduled automatically 
 
8.	AI generates discharge summary → Doctor approves → Auto-saved to EHR 
 
9.	Bed marked as “available” → New patient allocated instantly
